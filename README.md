# <center>Learning SASS

> ### My to do list

```css
Should be revised to centre the image.
Redo the logos, the title....
```

> ## The exercise :

* Create the repository:  `learning-sass`
* Create a basic html file :  `index.html`, just so we have something to play with.
* Create a folder and call it  `assets`  : it will contain all static files necessary for the visual look of the interface you are going to create. Images, css, javascript, fonts ...
* This "assets" folder structure has become a form of convention among frontend developers. Of course, it's up to you to get away from it, if you like reinventing the wheel.
* Create a  `style.scss`  file and configure your sass application to generate the  `style.css`  file each time the "source" file (style.scss) is modified.
* Make sure that your html file contains a  `<link rel="stylesheet" ... >`  refering to your.css file (and not to the.scss file).
* Finicky Take a good look at all the details that are animated. There is the part of the underside that increases in size, a text that appears, a shadow that forms, a zoom on the photo, and a change of color on the same photo.
* Don't use JS of course
* Expected result
